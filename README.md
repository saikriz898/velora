# VELORA ‚Äî A Learning Operating System

> **Enforced learning. Verified skills. Zero trust. Full audit.**

VELORA is not a course platform.  
It does not motivate. It does not forgive.  
It enforces real understanding through structure, discipline, and integrity.

Built for:
- Non-CS beginners entering tech  
- CS students with weak foundations  
- Self-learners who need truth, not certificates  

## Ì¥ê Core Principles
- **Consistency > Motivation**  
- **Explanation > Output**  
- **Proof > Promise**  
- **System Law > Human Will**  
- **Audit > Trust**  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Internal Engines
| Engine | Role |
|-------|------|
| `LUXERA` | Knowledge Intelligence (advises) |
| `AUREX` | Progression & Discipline (executes) |
| `VERITA` | Integrity & Governance (decides) |

## Ìªë Non-Negotiable Laws
1. No human admin access ‚Äî ever  
2. No AI answers during evaluation  
3. No skipping prerequisites  
4. Goal declaration required before learning  
5. Explanation required for every answer  
6. All actions permanently logged
