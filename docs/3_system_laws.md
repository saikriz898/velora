# System Laws (Immutable)

These are non-negotiable rules enforced structurally:

- Goal declaration is mandatory. No goal = no access.
- Daily quests are required. Missed? Punishment triggered.
- Evaluation requires both output AND explanation.
- Dungeons simulate real-world pressure. Escape allowed but logged.
- Skills are awarded only after VERITA validation.
- Resume is auto-generated from verified skills only.
- Interviews are AI-only, adaptive, and integrity-checked.
- Database schema is version-controlled. No direct edits.
- All prompts live in `/ai`. No inline AI use.
- Progress graph is immutable once written.

These laws define what VELORA *is*. Breaking them breaks the product.

They are frozen as of this document's first commit.
