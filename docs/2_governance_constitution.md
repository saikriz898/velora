# Governance Constitution

## Authority Chain
The system operates under three internal engines:

- **LUXERA** → Advises (knowledge intelligence)  
- **AUREX** → Executes (progression & discipline)  
- **VERITA** → Decides (integrity & truth validation)  

No engine may override another. All actions require consensus logging.

## Immutable Laws
These laws are hardcoded into system design and cannot be changed:

1. **No human admin access** — ever.  
2. **No manual skill creation or progress override.**  
3. **No skipping prerequisites.**  
4. **Every user action is logged permanently.**  
5. **AI may NEVER provide answers during evaluation or interviews.**  
6. **Goal must be declared before learning begins.**  
7. **Explanation required for every answer.**  

Violation of any law = system failure.

## Enforcement
- Code changes violating this constitution will be rejected.  
- All features must map to Phase 0–14 SDLC model.  
- No feature added without phase alignment.  

This constitution is binding from first commit.
